ðŸ“Š Advance Quantitative Analysis

This project showcases my ability to apply advanced statistical and analytical methods to real-world business problems using Excel. The work highlights my skills in data preparation, statistical modeling, and business-focused insights.

What I Demonstrated

Statistical Expertise: Conducted hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and variance sampling to solve managerial decision-making problems.

Data Analysis Tools: Built Excel models leveraging probability distributions, pivot tables, and conditional functions for clear and actionable insights.

Business Application: Translated raw data into practical recommendationsâ€”such as identifying behavioral patterns in consumer datasets (e.g., smoking/drinking trends) and analyzing market data (e.g., movie industry).

Analytical Mindset: Approached problems with rigor, from designing the analysis framework to interpreting results in a way that supports strategic business decisions.

Repository Contents

Movies.xlsx & MoviesSolution.xlsx â€“ exploratory data analysis and visualization of movie data.

SmokingDrinking.xlsx (+ solutions) â€“ segmentation and behavioral insights using pivot tables and conditional logic.

Normal Approximation to Binomial.xlsx â€“ applying probability theory for decision-making scenarios.

Sampling Distribution of Variance.xlsx â€“ variance estimation through sampling distribution techniques.

ðŸ’¡ Why it matters for employers: This project demonstrates not only my technical skills in quantitative analysis and Excel modeling, but also my ability to communicate results in a business contextâ€”a crucial skill for roles in analytics, finance, consulting, and strategy.
